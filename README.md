# Property-Dashboard
This repository contains HTML, CSS, and Javascript code for a dashboard used to control a home. Requirements were to create an interface allowing end users to turn off the lights in a four room property, and program the thermostat. Usability and accessibility were specifically emphasized. This is another project from Human & Computer Interaction class.
